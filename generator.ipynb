    "But, **Hard Mode** didn't fit as a `list`, so first, I changed the approach to a 'lazy evaluation'. Where equations and solutions would be written to the `.csv` file one at a time, instead of storing the whole dataset im RAM and then writing it to the `.csv`.\n",

    "+ Equations can't end with any of the operators *(`'/','*','+','-'`)*\n",
